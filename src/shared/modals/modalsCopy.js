          An apartment may be regulated under New York State’s system of Rent Stabilization if it is in a property that
          was built before 1974 and has six or more units or if the property has benefitted from certain regulatory
          programs like 421a or J-51. All properties in this report included at least one rent stabilized unit beginning
          in 2007, the first year for which we have data. We base stabilized unit numbers on property tax bills from the
          NYC Department of Finance. Missing or fluctuating numbers may be due to missing/incorrect registration by the
          owner or inconsistencies in property tax documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          We display the percentage of properties and units in buildings that have contained any rent stabilized units
          during this time period, even though not all units in those buildings are currently stabilized.

          This table includes scheduled foreclosure auctions, beginning with 5/15/2019. We update auctions scheduled in
          the next 90 days on a weekly basis. Auctions that have already occurred are still included. Before an auction
          occurs, the owner can still recuperate the property by paying off the owed debt: see information about
          pre-sale reinstatement and an overview of the entire foreclosure process{' '}
